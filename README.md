# Ego-Network Builder

A modern web application for students to create and visualize ego-networks similar to the [KINMATRIX dataset](https://kinmatrix.eu/). This application allows users to build comprehensive family networks by inputting information about themselves and their family members, then visualizing the resulting network structure.

## Features

### üèóÔ∏è Network Building
- **Ego Information**: Add your own details as the central node
- **Family Members**: Add comprehensive family member information including:
  - Full name, age, and gender
  - Relationship to you (father, mother, cousin, etc.)
  - Support for immediate family, extended family, in-laws, and step-family
- **Edit & Delete**: Modify or remove family members as needed
- **Data Persistence**: Your network data is automatically saved to your browser

### üìä Network Visualization
- **Interactive Graph**: Force-directed network visualization using react-force-graph-2d
- **Color-coded Nodes**: Nodes are color-coded by gender (Purple = Male, Yellow = Female, Green = Other)
- **Interactive Features**:
  - Click nodes to zoom in
  - Drag to move around the network
  - Toggle labels on/off
  - Reset view to original position
- **Network Statistics**: View counts of total members, relationships, and gender distribution
- **Data Export**: Download your network data as JSON
- **Optimized Spacing**: Nodes maintain proper spacing for better visualization

### üé® Modern UI/UX
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Beautiful Interface**: Clean, modern design with Tailwind CSS
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Easy switching between building and visualization modes
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of completion status
- **Custom Logo**: Ego network icon representing the central node concept
- **Favicon**: Custom favicon for better brand recognition

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd EgoNetworkApp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to start using the application.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with the production-ready files.

## How to Use

### 1. Building Your Network

1. **Add Your Information**: Start by entering your name, age, and gender as the central node (ego)
2. **Add Family Members**: Click "Add Family Member" to add relatives
3. **Complete Information**: For each family member, provide:
   - Full name
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Relationship to you (select from categorized options)
4. **Review & Edit**: Use the list view to review, edit, or remove family members

### 2. Visualizing Your Network

1. **Switch to Visualization**: Click "View Network Visualization" when you have data
2. **Explore the Network**:
   - The blue node represents you (ego)
   - Other nodes represent family members, color-coded by relationship
   - Lines show connections from you to each family member
3. **Interactive Features**:
   - Click any node to zoom in
   - Drag to pan around the network
   - Use controls to show/hide labels or reset the view
4. **Export Data**: Download your network data for further analysis

## Relationship Categories

The application supports comprehensive relationship types:

- **Immediate Family**: father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, husband, wife, spouse, partner
- **Extended Family**: grandfather, grandmother, uncle, aunt, cousin
- **In-Laws**: father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law
- **Step Family**: stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, stepsister
- **Other**: adoptive parent, adopted child, foster parent, foster child, guardian, other relative

## Technical Details

### Built With
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and context
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **react-force-graph-2d**: Interactive network visualization
- **Lucide React**: Beautiful icons
- **Local Storage**: Data persistence in the browser
